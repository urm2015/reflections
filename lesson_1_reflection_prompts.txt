How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it narrowed it down to only the differences

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    it can show you exactly what you changed

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros-you are in control of when it happens; you can create your own spots to 
    	commit to; you don't have too many versions
    cons-too many versions; commit at points in the middle of code; commits at the 
    	wrong times

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    saving just one file instead of multiples will save space on your computer;
    treating each file separately does not make one dependant on another

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will show you what change was made in each commit
    git diff will show you what you changed in each commit

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    if your new version does not work correctly you can always revet back to a
    version that worked

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    to try to track changes on future projects
