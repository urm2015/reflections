When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you need other people to view your work
  When you need other people to work on your files
  When you want to access your work from more than one device

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	All changes you make in github amy not be the final version that you want to keep for your project
	If other people make changes to your repository in github it may be changes you do not want to incorporate
